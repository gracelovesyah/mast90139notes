The practical class described here is focused on multivariate statistics, specifically linear regression and principal component regression. Let's break down what the class is trying to convey:

1. **Linear Regression with Centered Data**: 
    - The problem starts with a linear regression model where the expected value of $Z_i$ given $X_i$ is a linear function of $X_i$. 
    - The least squares (LS) method is used to estimate the parameters of this model. The LS method minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values of $Z_i$.
    - The problem then introduces the concept of centering the data. Centering is subtracting the mean from each observation. This is often done to simplify the calculations and interpretation in regression.
    - The solution shows how the LS problem for the original data can be transformed into an LS problem for the centered data. This transformation simplifies the estimation of the regression coefficient $ \beta $ and shows that the intercept $ \alpha $ can be easily derived from the mean values of $Z$ and $X$.

2. **Prediction with New Data**:
    - Once the regression coefficients are estimated, they can be used to predict the value of $Z_{new}$ for a new observation $X_{new}$. 
    - The formula provided shows how to make this prediction using the centered data approach.

3. **Principal Component Regression**:
    - The class introduces the concept of principal component regression (PCR). PCR is a method that first reduces the dimensionality of the predictors using principal component analysis (PCA) and then performs regression on the principal components.
    - The formula provided suggests that instead of using all the original predictors $X$, one can use the first $q$ principal components $Y$ to make predictions. This can be especially useful when the number of predictors is large, as it can simplify the model and potentially improve its predictive performance.
    - The class asks to prove that $X_{new} - \bar{X}$ is centered, which is straightforward since subtracting the mean from any observation will always result in a centered value.

4. **Practical Application**:
    - The class provides a dataset (`Xtrainphoneme` and `Ztrainphoneme`) and asks students to apply the concepts learned to predict values of $Z$ for new observations in `Xtestphoneme`.
    - Students are asked to use both the standard LS predictor and the PCR predictor for various values of $q$.
    - The performance of these predictions is to be evaluated by comparing them to the true values in `Ztestphoneme` using boxplots of the log of the squared prediction errors. Additionally, scatter plots of predicted vs. true values are to be created for the LS method and the best PCR method.
    - The goal is to see how well the standard LS method performs compared to PCR and to determine the optimal number of principal components to use in PCR.

**Conclusion**:
This practical class aims to teach students about linear regression with centered data and principal component regression. It emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing (like centering) and introduces a dimensionality reduction technique (PCR) that can be used when dealing with high-dimensional data. The practical application at the end ensures that students understand how to implement these methods and evaluate their performance in real-world scenarios.
