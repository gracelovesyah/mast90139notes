# 2.5 Model selection in logistic regression
## Backward Elimination
```{code}
drop1() # drop1(lmod, test="Chi")
lmodr <- step(lmod, trace=0, k=2); 
sumary(lmodr)  #k=2 or log(n) for AIC or BIC
```

```{note}
Backwards elimination started with the full model. P-value of each dropped predictor will be compared to decide which will be dropped (by eliminating the **largest** p-value-predictor). Drop function will be stopped when there's no greater than 0.5 p-values/ 
```

AIC = -2logL+2q <=> AIC=deviance+2q (use q logn not 2q if BIC)
